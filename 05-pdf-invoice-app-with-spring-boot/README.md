In this module, I practiced:
- how to create a spring boot app by means of initializer
- pom.xml components for a spring boot app; parent project, maven plugin, starter dependencies
- advantatgeous of spring boot; dependency management, auto-configuration etc.
- what is a starter dependency and how to add a new one into project
- database configuration through application.properties
- spring boot internal auto-configuration classes created based on @Conditionals
- spring boot internal starter dependency modules containing only pom.xml which enables dependency management
